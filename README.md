# Heuristic Agent
AI 1 course - homework 1. The objective was te develop agents able to play a single-player game (heuristic search) and a multi-player, zero-sum, perfect-information game (adversarial search) and to evaluate how different algorithms and heuristics can affect the agents' behaviour.

This repo contains:
* a report (theoretical framework, notes on formal aspects of agents, experiments and results)
* a Jupyter notebook (core classes of the implementation: algorithms, heuristics, agents, utilities, ...)
* 'snake' module (personal implementation of snake game logic)
* 'stats' module (personal implementation of a simple dataframe manager)
* Snake/Chess Experiments (experimental results)

**Disclaimer**: no evidence was sought from the experiments, they were used only to get some insights!
